## Overview

[Data model](../design/large_grants_data_model.html#Large grants data model)

Large grants are applied for using a Salesforce Digital Experience. 

Before that, an applicant will usually complete an Expression of Interest 
using Funding Frontend.  If an EOI is examined and meets funding criteria,
then the applicant is invited to apply for funding using the Salesforce
Digital Experience.

If an applicant does not create an EOI, they will need to register
on Funding Frontend with the same email that they used to 
apply with on the Salesforce Digital Experience before they can begin
the PTS process.

Essentially, a large application is:

- Submitted using the Salesforce Digital Experience.
- Processed in Salesforce, usually by an investment manager.
- When the application hits the monitoring stage in Salesforce,
the Permission to Start process can begin in Funding Frontend
- Permission to start process ends in Funding frontend
- Processing of the application, including payment, continues in Salesforce.
