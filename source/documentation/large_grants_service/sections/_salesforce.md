## Salesforce
### Applying for a large grant
The applicant will be sent a link to their email.  It's important that the 
email used is the one that they used to register with Funding Frontend 
when completing their EOI.

From the link in the email, the applicant can complete the application in
Salesforce Experience.  Once the applicant has submitted the application, 
it will be visible to Fund staff in Salesforce.

Once the application is ready for permission to start (PTS) the Owning 
will check "Start the legal agreement process" on the monitoring stage 
of the application in Salesforce.

### Receiving a permission to start
The Funding frontend process for a permission to start, described below,
will end by submitting a signed permission to start document back to Salesforce.

This signed document will be uploaded against a 'Large Grants Permission to Start'
record which can be found in the Forms tab of the large application in Salesforce.

### Payment
The payment process is manual. Eventually Salesforce and Funding Frontend will
be developed to help with this.
